I started the [Birkbeck Institute for Data Analytics](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/research/centres/birkbeck-institute-for-data-analytics/).

Please see my [institutional web page](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/our-staff/profile/8920719/alessandro-provetti) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-provetti/) or even [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/alessandro.provetti/).

I create and maintain teaching materials for those willing to learn, e.g., [learn-web](https://github.com/ale66/learn-web/) and [learn-genai](https://github.com/ale66/learn-genai/). 

My research output consists mostly of scientific papers that are indexed on [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6603433202) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=pwOBPBQAAAAJ).

Currently I am working on [image generation from collections](https://ale66.github.io/VA-design-generator/) and on [Network Centrality](https://github.com/ale66/Montecarlo-Potential-Gain). 

After all these years... I still love simple, easy-to-scrape Web pages.
