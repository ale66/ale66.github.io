Currently I am Programme director for the MSc in Data Science at [Birkbeck, University of London](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/). 
Also, I have been the funding director of the [Birkbeck Institute for Data Analytics](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/research/centres/birkbeck-institute-for-data-analytics/). 
I am-still-a lover simple, easy-to-scrape Web pages.

Please see my [institutional web page](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/our-staff/profile/8920719/alessandro-provetti). 
Or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/alessandro.provetti/). 

My research output consists mostly of scientific papers that are indexed on [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6603433202) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=pwOBPBQAAAAJ). 

I often busy creating and maintaining teaching materials for my students, in particular for the [Data Science Techniques and Applications](https://ale66.github.io/dsta/) module at Birkbeck.

Currently I am working on [image generation from collections](https://ale66.github.io/VA-design-generator/) and on [Network Centrality measures](https://github.com/ale66/Montecarlo-Potential-Gain).
