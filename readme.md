### ![](./imgs/ale-caricature2.jpg) Welcome to my GitHub Page

Please see my [institutional web page](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/our-staff/profile/8920719/alessandro-provetti) at [Birkbeck, University of London](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/). 

My research output consists mostly of scientific papers that are indexed on [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6603433202) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=pwOBPBQAAAAJ). 

I often busy creating and maintaining teaching materials for my students, in particular for the [Data Science Techniques and Applications](https://ale66.github.io/dsta/) module at Birkbeck.
